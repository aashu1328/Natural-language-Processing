              " 'tokens': 'WHY THIS BELATED REVIEW ? I feel very obliged to share my views about this old workhorse , the HP12C GOLD at its 25th anniversary and my 1Oth year as a satisfied ower user and fan . Especially after sharing my frank views on Amazon about two of its three successors on Amazon.com , burying the HP12c Platinum ( 2004 1st release , HP12cP ) and praising the HP12c Platiunum Anniversary Edition ( 2006 3rd release , HP12cPAE or HP12cPA).To the majority of HP 12c calculator owners and fans , including the non - techkie nerd like myself , the name Hewlett - Packard To the majority of HP 12c calculator owners and fans . The brandname of Hewlett - Packard is synonymous with the highest quality and best range offered in handheld electronic business financial calculators before the first generation of personal computers hits the desktops of business users . To date ( December 2007 ) , the bearer of this \" gold \" standard is none other than the HP12C HP \\'s \" golden boy \" in its calculator business segment . The HP12C now a matured product , is the only continuing HP handheld surviving calculator product since \\' 81 and probably the longest selling electronic calculator ever . According to HP almost 15 million HP 12Cs , cPs was sold since , it is probably the best selling HP ( and RPN ) calculator ever . As a proven product , the HP12C \" gold \" works from day 1 , with its form factor and sofware remaining unchanged and has not been dethroned by rivals and even its HP successors which had come and go . Even with PC software versions being sold , the 12C remains the truly indispensable \" portable \" finance - business heldheld computer for its owners , professionals and students alike . This handy companion powers up immediately and is faster than any portable personal computers to jump right into the action . The HP12C is a serious product and the ultimate time tested solution , field tested proven by its users and survived all its rival products , the workhorse moves on . Anyone in charge of this HP line should always bear in mind that the continued production run of the HP 12c is a testimony of HP \\'s quality and standard expected by its customers . Don\\'t just listen to a HP12C fan here , I own and am using three out of 4 models of the HP 12C series , and it is amusing and somewhat disappointing to observe that it had taken HP at least four years and two major upgrades of the HP 12c Platinium , in its futile attempt to \" fix & retire \" the HP12C with three successors in the form of HP12cPlatinum since 2004.It would seems especially frustrating on the part of HP , to realize after all the effort spent on remaking the HP12cPlatinum models that it would not outdone its siblings the HP10bII and HP17bII+ series to seriously challenge the HP12C Gold .   However , by their own rights the HP10Bs and HP17Bs , and the HP12cPlatinum may find their rightful place in the HP financial calculator line , differentiating the HP12C GOLD in terms of price and functions . IMHO , this had happened because the following golden rules were infringed by HP ... GOLDEN RULE I - A PRODUCT WHICH STILL SELLS ITSELF IS NEVER OBSOLETE.GOLDEN RULE II - IF IT AREN\\'T BROKEN , DON\\'t FIX IT ! \" The gold rule of thumb should always be guarded as gospel by the HP heldheld calculator product team . Based on the same reasoning , the HP12C \\'s built quality and product standard is paramount to its users . GOLDEN RULE III - ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS ! If in doubt , see rules I & II.GOLDEN RULE IV - ONLY OUTSOURCE THE MANUFACTURING OF YOUR PRODUCT TO SOMEONE WHO COULD BETTER YOUR OWN PRODUCT QUALITY . If in doubt ask IBM about Lenovo . GOLDEN RULE V - THE BENCHMARKING INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE IS THE HP12C. Just in case , if HP does not know or is not listening to its customers . GOLDEN RULE VI - DO NOT DISCONTINUE THE ICONIC HP12C GOLD . HP needs no reminder that the customer is always right . Please let your customer , the ultimate market force decide if the HP12C should ever be retired . As an ardent fan of HP12C and line of financial business & scientific calculators , I am of the view that the day when HP discontinue the HP12C would be the day it exit this business segment . I speculate this would happen when the HP brandname disappears from the 12C just like after IBM name had disappeared from ThinkPads and ThinkCentres . Since the price of GOLD is on the rise , it is indeed puzzling to fans of the HP12C , why HP did not release a genuine HP12C gold 25th anniversary model for the fans to mark the occasion , if replacing the discontinuing the HP12C GOLD is the intention READ ALL GOLDEN RULES above . To be fair , the silver HP12c Platinum Anniversary is very nice and has spotted the \" retro \" silver look of the HP 11C , however , it is still not the GOLD standard . With HP missing this golden opportunity to mark the occasion , I would love to see and own a HP 12C engraved with 50th Anniversary logo , reckon that this would be the ultimate testimony for the HP12C and a milestone for its fans . Looking forward , a GOLD 50th anniversary HP12C Anniversary model would be very nice for the fans . For HP , this is a lucrative business proposition . By now , they would have realized that if they have any of its products which could hit a 50th year home run   in 2031 , it would not be from its other product line - it would be this original HP12C GOLD standard bearer . So please treat the old workhorse with the upmost respect !'}"
